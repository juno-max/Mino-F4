# MINO NO-CODE PLATFORM - MISSION & VISION

## Executive Summary

Build a professional no-code Enterprise Web Agent Platform that enables **power builders** (technical operators, not traditional developers) to create, validate, and deploy intelligent web automation workflows through **conversational teaching** and **systematic ground truth validation**.

**Target Market**: 50M power builders - product engineers, data engineers, operations engineers at mid-to-enterprise companies who need to automate complex manual workflows that feed into core business systems.

**Core Value Proposition**: Transform from **5 hours of manual web work monthly** to **10 minutes of teaching Mino once**, with **systematic accuracy improvement from 60% → 95%** through ground truth testing.

## Product Philosophy

### The Teaching Paradigm

**Traditional Approach**: Users configure complex automation tools upfront  
**Mino Approach**: Users teach Mino through natural demonstration, then validate and refine

The user is the **domain expert**. Mino is the **capable apprentice** that learns through:
1. **Observation** (screen share workflow capture)
2. **Validation** (ground truth test runs)
3. **Refinement** (systematic accuracy improvement)
4. **Deployment** (production-grade execution at scale)

### Key Design Principles

1. **Professional Tone**: Enterprise language, not gaming or consumer app patterns
2. **Respect User Expertise**: Users are teaching, not being taught
3. **Systematic Validation**: Ground truth testing before production scale
4. **Transparent Learning**: Show accuracy curves, confidence levels, failure patterns
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complexity reveals with user proficiency
6. **Business Value Focus**: ROI metrics, time savings, accuracy improvements
